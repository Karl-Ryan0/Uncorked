        Blackberry wine is a luscious and flavorful beverage that's perfect for sipping on a cozy evening or sharing with friends and family. With its deep, rich color 
        and sweet-tart taste, blackberry wine is a great way to enjoy the taste of summer all year round. Making blackberry wine at home is surprisingly easy, and with just 
        a few simple ingredients, you can create a delicious and impressive batch. So, if you're looking for a fun and rewarding project that will yield a delicious result, 
        try making your own blackberry wine! I always aim for a ten litre batch but this recipe can be scaled up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Blackberries are a great choice for winemaking, as they're packed with natural sugars and acids that are perfect for fermenting. To get started, all you need is some 
        fresh blackberries, sugar, water, and a few basic winemaking supplies. Blackberry wine can be made in a variety of styles, from dry to sweet, depending on your preference. 
        It also pairs well with a variety of foods, from grilled meats to rich chocolate desserts. Whether you're a seasoned winemaker or a curious beginner, making blackberry wine 
        is a fun and rewarding project that will yield a delicious result. So, grab some fresh blackberries and let's get started!
    </p>
    <p>Blackberries grow in abundance in Ireland, and are best harvested in September when they're fully ripe. Avoid ones not fully ripened as this can lead to a sour taste in the wine. 
        Be careful of the thorns!

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by washing all your blackberries if you picked from the wild. Not necessary if using frozen.</li>
        <li>Sterilise all your equipment that you're going to use.</li>
        <li>Add some boiling water into the fermentation bucket.</li>
        <li>Add the blackberries into the straining bag, and then into the bucket. This will minimise the amount of fruit lumps in your wine.</li>
        <li>Mash up the blackberries inside the straining bag. No need to pulverise them, just a good mashing.</li>
        <li>Toss in a teaspoonful of pectic enzyme, acid blend if using it, and yeast nutrient.</li>
        <li>Add in the sugar, and then bring up the water to 11 litres, give everything a stir.</li>
        <li>Add in one crushed campten tablet, take your first reading and then wait for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>After the 24 hours, throw the yeast in and cover the bucket with an airlock. By the next day you should see bubbles moving through the airlock: this means fermentation is taking place.</li>
        <li>Leave this for a week, then if bubbling is slowing down, remove the straining bag of blackberries and discard, then syphon from the bucket into your 2 
            sterilised demijohns, trying to avoid the sediment at the bottom of the bucket.</li>
        <li>Leave in the demijohns for about 6 weeks, you should see bubbling stopping completely and the wine will be clearer.</li>
        <li>At this point take your second reading. If it is at 1.0, or the same over a 5 day period, then it's ready to bottle.</li>
        <li>Your wine is ready to drink now but will improve with time as the complex flavors intertwine. Can be aged for up to 2 years.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Some tips also using the content class -->
<section class="content">
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to carbonate and make a sparkling wine, add 10 grams of sugar to a 750ml bottle and leave for 2 weeks in a warm location. Make sure to use a pressure resistant bottle to avoid
            a bomb!</li>
        <li>Blackberry wine can take a long time to clear. No problem if it's still opaque after 2 months, the taste will still be great.</li>
        <li>Using frozen blackberries will make the process easier as they release juices easier when frozen.</li> 
        <li>This will produce a deep, sweet wine, perfect as a dessert wine.</li>
        <li>A bucket with a built-in tap will make the initial racking to demijohns easier.</li>
    </ul>
