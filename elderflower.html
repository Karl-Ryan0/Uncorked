        Elderflower champagne is a light and effervescent drink that's perfect for celebrating any occasion. With its delicate floral flavor and sparkling bubbles, it's a refreshing 
        alternative to traditional champagne. Making elderflower champagne at home is surprisingly easy and requires just a few simple ingredients, including fresh elderflowers, sugar,
         water, and some basic winemaking supplies. With a little bit of time and patience, you can create a delicious and impressive beverage that's sure to impress your guests. So, if you're 
         looking for a fun and creative project that will yield a delicious and unique champagne, give elderflower champagne a try! I always aim for a ten litre batch but this recipe can be scaled up or down.

        Not only is elderflower champagne delicious, but it also offers some health benefits. Elderflowers are known for their immune-boosting properties and are often used in traditional
         medicine to treat colds, flu, and other respiratory ailments. The flowers are also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect your body against damage caused by free radicals. 
         Additionally, elderflowers have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the body. So, not only will you be sipping on a tasty beverage, but 
         you'll also be doing your body a favor by consuming this healthful and rejuvenating drink.

        Elderflowers bloom in Ireland between late May to July and can be harvested quite easily. Don't forget that as this is a champagne recipe and not an ordinary wine recipe, you'll need to 
        make sure you're using pressure resistant bottles like champagne bottles, alternatively a good solution is to use plastic bottles like the ones

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by shaking as much debris from your Elderflower heads, then using a fork, try to remove as much as the flowers from the stems.</li>
        <li>Sterilise all your equipment that you're going to use.</li>
        <li>Add some boiling water into the fermentation bucket.</li>
        <li>Add the elderflowers into the straining bag, and then into the bucket. This will minimise the amount of flowers in your champagne.</li>
        <li>Toss in a teaspoonful of pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient.</li>
        <li>Add in the sugar, and then bring up the water to 11 litres, give everything a stir.</li>
        <li>Add in one crushed campten tablet, take your first reading and then wait for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>After the 24 hours, throw the yeast in and cover the bucket with an airlock. By the next day you should see bubbles moving through the airlock: this means fermentation is taking place.</li>
        <li>Leave this for a week, then if bubbling is slowing down, remove the straining bag of elderflowers and discard, then syphon from the bucket into your 2 
            sterilised demijohns, trying to avoid the sediment at the bottom of the bucket.</li>
        <li>Leave in the demijohns for a day, and take a reading with your hydrometer. If it's not at 1.010, check again the next day.</li>
        <li>If your hydrometer reading is at 1.010, bottle it. No need to add priming sugar.</li>
        <li>Leave this for a week for fermentation to finish and carbonation to build.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

<section class="content">
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you prefer this to be flat, simply leave to ferment for another 2 weeks inside the demijohns, then bottle.</li>
        <li>When elderflowers are out of season, you can substitute for elderflower cordial, but you may need to experiment with the amount of sugar used.</li>
        <li>This will produce a bright, light, very fizzy champagne. Perfect for lazy summer evenings right out of the fridge.</li>
        <li>A bucket with a built-in tap will make the initial racking to demijohns easier.</li>
    </ul>
