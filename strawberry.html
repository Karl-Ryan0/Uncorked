            Strawberry wine is a delicious and refreshing beverage that's perfect for sipping on a warm summer day. It's also surprisingly easy to make at

            is sure to impress. With its sweet and fruity flavor and beautiful bright red color, it's the perfect drink to share with friends and family at your next gathering. 
            So, let's get started and learn how to make this delicious strawberry wine! I always aim for a ten litre batch but this recipe can be scaled up or down.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the great things about making strawberry wine at home is that you can customize the recipe to suit your taste. For example, if you prefer a sweeter wine, you can 
            increase the amount of sugar in the recipe. If you like your wine with a bit more acidity, you can add some acid blend to the mix. You can also experiment with different types of 
            yeast to achieve different flavor profiles. Once you've made a batch of strawberry wine, you can enjoy it right away or age it in a cool, dark place for several months to allow the 
            flavors to develop and mature. With a little bit of patience and creativity, you can create a delicious and unique strawberry wine that's sure to impress your taste buds and those of your guests.

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by washing all the strawberries and removing the hulls. No need to chop.</li>
            <li>Sterilise all your equipment that you're going to use.</li>
            <li>Add some boiling water into the fermentation bucket.</li>
            <li>Add the strawberries into the straining bag, and then into the bucket. This will minimise the amount of fruit lumps in your wine.</li>
            <li>Smash up the strawberries inside the straining bag. No need to pulverise them, just a good mashing.</li>
            <li>Toss in a teaspoonful of pectic enzyme, acid blend if using it, and yeast nutrient.</li>
            <li>Add in the sugar, and then bring up the water to 11 litres, give everything a stir.</li>
            <li>Add in one crushed campten tablet, take your first reading and then wait for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>After the 24 hours, throw the yeast in and cover the bucket with an airlock. By the next day you should see bubbles moving through the airlock: this means fermentation is taking place.</li>
            <li>Leave this for a week, then if bubbling is slowing down, remove the straining bag of strawberries and discard, then syphon from the bucket into your 2 sterilised demijohns, trying to avoid the sediment at the bottom of the bucket.</li>
            <li>Leave in the demijohns for about 3 weeks, you should see bubbling stopping completely and the wine will be clearer.</li>
            <li>At this point take your second reading. If it is at 1.0, or the same over a 5 day period, then it's ready to bottle.</li>
            <li>Your wine is ready to drink now but will improve with time as the complex flavors intertwine. Can be aged for up to a year.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

    <section class="content">
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to carbonate and make a sparkling wine, add 10 grams of sugar to a 750ml bottle and leave for 2 weeks in a warm location. Make sure to use a pressure resistant bottle to avoid
                a bomb!</li>
            <li>Using frozen strawberries will make the process easier as they release juices easier when frozen.</li>
            <li>This might look like a red wine but it behaves more like a white - it's thin and light, and great out of the fridge.</li>
            <li>A bucket with a built-in tap will make the initial racking to demijohns easier.</li>
